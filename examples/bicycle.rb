#Based on: https://physicstasks.eu/280/bicyclist-going-uphill

# A bicyclist is going up a 5% slope by a uniform speed of 27 kmÂ·h-1.
# The magnitude of the air resistance force is given by Fres = 0.5.density*k*v2*x-sectional area where the numerical value of {k} = 0.5.
# The mass of the bicyclist including the bike is 70 kg. Do not consider the rolling resistance.

# What forward force exerted on the bike by the road is needed to make the bicyclist move with constant speed?
# How much work does the bicyclist do when riding a distance of 1200 m? What is the power of the bicyclist during the ride?
# Assume there is no loss of mechanical energy.
